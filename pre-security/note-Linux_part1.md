# Linux Fundamentals Part 1 (TryHackMe - Pre Security)
**Platform:** TryHackMe (Pre Security path)  
**VM / Lab:** Browser modules  
**Time spent:** 20 min

## Objective
Embark on the journey of learning the fundamentals of Linux. Learn to run some of the first essential commands on an interactive terminal.

## Core Concepts Covered
1. Introduction to Linux
    - Linux is an open-source Operating System used in servers, hacking labs, and developments.
    - It’s preferred for its flexibility, security, and command-line power.
2. Background on Linux
    - Linux powers websites, smart cars, POS systems, and industrial controllers.
    - It’s based on Unix and comes in many “flavors” like Ubuntu and Debian.
3. Running First Few Commands
    - `echo "text"`: Outputs text to the terminal.
    - `whoami`: Displays the current logged-in user.
    - `ls`: Lists files in the current directory.
    - `cd foldername`: Changes directory.
    - `cat filename`: Displays file contents.
    - `pwd`: Prints the current working directory
    - `find -name filename`: Searches for files by name.
    - `find -name "*.txt"`: Uses wildcards to find all .txt files.
    - `grep "search_term" filename`: Searches inside files for specific terms.
4. Introduction to Shell Operators
    - `&`: Runs commands in the background.
    - `&&`: Runs second command only if the first succeeds.
    - `>`: Redirects output to a file (overwrites).
    - `>>`: Appends output to a file (preserves existing content).

## Learning and Reflections
- Learned about linux and its history.
- Learned different commands used in navigating the file system.
- Learned about shell operators.
