# Intro to LAN (TryHackMe - Pre Security)
**Platform:** TryHackMe (Pre Security path)  
**VM / Lab:** Browser modules  
**Time spent:** 15 min

## Objective
Learn about some of the technologies and designs that power private networks

## Core Concepts Covered
1. LAN Topologies
    - **Star Topology**: Devices connected through a central hub/switch. Reliable and scalable but costly.
    - **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single backbone cable. Simple but prone to collisions.
    - **Ring Topology**: Devices form a circular path. Data travels in one direction, failure in one node affects the whole network.
2. Subnetting Primer
    - Introduces IP address segmentation.
    - Explains how subnet masks help divide networks into smaller, manageable parts.
    - Useful for organizing devices and improving security.
3. ARP Protocol (Address Resolution Protocol)
    - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
    - Essential for devices to locate each other on a LAN.
4. DHCP Protocol (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    - Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
    - Reduces manual configuration and ensures efficient IP management.

## Learning and Reflections
- Learned about different topologies and their uses.
- Learned about subnetting.
- Learned about ARP and DHCP.
