Begin learning the fundamentals of computer networking in this bite-sized and interactive module

## Core Concepts Covered
1. What is Networking?
    - Networking is the connection of devices to share data.
    - Analogies include social networks, postal systems, and power grids.
    - In computing, it spans from two devices to billions

    - Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW).
3. Identifying Devices on a Network
    - Explains IP addresses, MAC addresses, and how devices are uniquely identified.
    - Covers basic tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.
4. Ping (ICMP Protocol)
    - Demonstrates how devices check connectivity.
    - ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol.
    - ICMP packets are used to test reachability and measure latency.

## Learning and Reflections:
- Learned about the basics of Networking.
- Understood the concepts of Internet, Ping with ICMP packets.
