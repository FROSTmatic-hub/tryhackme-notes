## Modules & Progress

My TryHackMe learning notes are organized by path/module. Click into any folder to see detailed notes.

- **Pre-Security** — Completed ✅  
  Path folder: [`pre-security/`](pre-security/) — foundational networking, HTTP, DNS, and Linux basics.

### How I document work
For each lesson I add:
- `note-*.md` — the lesson writeup using my template (Objective, Commands, Findings, PoC, Remediation, Reflection)
- `images/<module>/` — screenshots and visual proofs
- `outputs/<module>/` — raw command outputs (logs, text dumps)

All testing is performed in lab environments I own or in TryHackMe sanctioned VMs.
