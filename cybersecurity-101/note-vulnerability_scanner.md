## Core Concepts Covered
1. Vulnerabilities
    - **What Is a Vulnerability**
        * A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, hardware, or configuration that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or compromise data.
    - **Common Types**
        * Software bugs (eg, buffer overflows, SQL injection)
        * Misconfigurations (eg, open ports, default credentials)
        * Unpatched systems (eg, outdated OS or applications)
        * Design flaws (eg, insecure protocols or logic errors)
2. Patching
    - **What Is Patching**
        * Patching is the process of applying updates or fixes to software, firmware, or systems to:
            * Fix vulnerabilities
            * Improve performance
            * Add new features
            * Ensure compliance
    - **Patch Types**
        * Security patches: Address known vulnerabilities.
        * Bug fixes: Resolve functional issues.
        * Feature updates: Add enhancements or new capabilities.
    - **Patch Management Workflow**
        1. **Identify** vulnerable assets
        2. **Test** patches in a staging environment
        3. **Deploy** patches to production systems
        4. **Verify** successful application
        5. **Document** and audit the process
3. Vulnerability Scanning
    - **What Is Vulnerability Scanning?**
        * A process of inspecting digital systems (networks, hosts, applications) to identify security weaknesses.
        * Helps organizations proactively detect and fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
        * Essential for risk management, compliance, and security hygiene.
    - **Why It’s Important**
        * New vulnerabilities emerge daily.
        * Compliance standards (eg, PCI-DSS, HIPAA) often mandate regular scans.
        * Manual scanning is time-consuming and prone to human error.
        * Automated tools are preferred for speed, accuracy, and coverage.
    - **Automated Vulnerability Scanning Tools**
        * These tools can scan entire systems and networks.
        * Identify:
            * Vulnerable hosts/IPs
            * Type of vulnerability
            * Severity level
            * Recommended fixes
        * Examples: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys, Rapid7
    - **Types of Vulnerability Scans**
        * **Internal vs External Scans**
            * Internal Scans:
                * Run inside the network
                * Detect vulnerabilities post-breach
                * Focus on internal systems
            * External Scans:
                * Run outside the network
                * Detect vulnerabilities pre-breach
                * Focus on public-facing assets
        * **Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scans**
            * Authenticated Scans:
                * Uses valid credentials to access system internals
                * Typically used for internal scans
            * Unauthenticated Scans:
                * Scans without credentials, limited visibility
                * Common for external scans to simulate outsider view
4. Tools for Vulnerability Scanning
    - Vulnerability scanning tools help identify, assess, and report security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications.
    - The tools vary in deployment models, feature sets, and suitability for different environments.
    - **Tools for Scanning**
        *  **Nessus**
            * Originally open-source (1998), later commercialized by Tenable in 2005.
            * Offers extensive vulnerability scanning capabilities.
            * Maintains a large database of known vulnerabilities.
            * Widely used by security professionals for system and network assessments.
            * Supports custom scan policies and plugin-based detection.
            * Ideal for internal scans and compliance auditing.
        *  **Qualys**
            * Developed in 1999 as a subscription-based solution.
            * Fully cloud-based hence no local installation required.

5. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and ExposureS)
    - **What Is CVE?**
        * CVE is a standardized identifier for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
        * Each CVE entry provides a unique ID, a brief description, and references to external sources for more details.
        * Managed by MITRE Corporation and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
        * Helps organizations track and prioritize vulnerabilities consistently across tools and platforms.
    - **CVE Structure Breakdown**
        * A CVE ID follows this format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN`
        * `CVE`: Prefix indicating it's a CVE entry
        * `YYYY`: Year the CVE was assigned or made public
        * `NNNN`: Unique numeric identifier (can be 4 to 7 digits)
        * Example: `CVE-2021-44228`
        * Refers to the Log4Shell vulnerability in Apache Log4j.
6. CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
    - **What is CVSS?**
        * CVSS provides a numerical score (0.0 to 10.0) to quantify the severity of a vulnerability.
        * It helps prioritize remediation based on risk.
        * Developed by FIRST.org
        * Considers factors like exploitability, impact, and environmental context.
    - **CVSS Score Ranges**
        1. **0.0**
            * Security Level none
            * No impact or risk
        2. **0.1 – 3.9**
            * Security Level low
            * Minor impact, low urgency
        3. **4.0 – 6.9**
            * Security Level medium
            * Moderate risk, needs attention
        4. **7.0 – 8.9**
            * Security Level high
            * Serious threat, should be patched soon
        5. **9.0 – 10.0**
            * Security Level critical
            * Severe impact, immediate action required
