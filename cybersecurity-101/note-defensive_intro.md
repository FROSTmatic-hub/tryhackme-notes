# Defensive Security Intro (TryHackMe - Cyber Security 101)
**Platform:** TryHackMe (Cyber Security 101 path)  
**VM / Lab:** Browser modules  
**Time spent:** 15 min

## Objective
Introducing defensive security and related topics, such as Threat Intelligence, SOC, DFIR, Malware Analysis, and SIEM

## Core Concepts Covered
1. What is Defensive Security (Blue Team)?
    - Focuses on protecting an organization's IT infrastructure.
    - Core responsibilities include:
        - Preventing intrusions.
        - Detecting intrusions.
        - Responding effectively to intrusions.
2. What is a SOC (Security Operations Centre)?
    - A team of cybersecurity professionals that monitors networks and systems.
    - They instantly detect and respond to malicious cybersecurity events.
    - Core Areas of SOC includes:
       - Stay updated on industry threats and vulnerabilities.
       - Monitor adherence to organizational security policies.
       - Investigate deviations to maintain trust and integrity.
       - Respond swiftly to minimize damage.
3. What is Digital Forensics?
    - Applies traditional forensic methods to digital devices.
    - Focuses on preserving and analyzing digital evidence during investigations, example, data breaches, etc.
    - Key Sources of Digital Evidence:
        1. **File System**: Reveals created, overwritten, and deleted files from low-level storage analysis.
        2. **System Memory**: Captures volatile data from programs running in memory.
        3. **System Logs**: Tracks system activities, traces often remain even after deletion attempts.
        4. **Network Logs**: Monitors traffic to identify signs of attacks and understand their scope.
4. What is Incident Response?
    - A structured approach to handling cybersecurity incidents like breaches or data leaks.
    - Aims to minimize damage, contain threats, and recover quickly.
    - Four Key Stages of Incident Response:
        1. Preparation:
            - Develop policies, procedures, and training.
            - Implement security measures
        2. Detection and Analysis:
            - Monitor systems and networks for suspicious activity.
            - Analyze events to confirm incidents.
        3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:
            - Limit the impact of the incident.
            - Remove threats.
            - Restore affected services and systems.
        4. Post-Incident Activity:
            - Review the incident and response.
            - Update policies and training based on lessons learned.

## Learning and Reflections
- Learned briefly about defensive security.
- Learned about SOC and their roles.
- Learned how digital devices are scanned using digital forensics.
- Learned how responses are treated effectively.
